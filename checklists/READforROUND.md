__Remember to read this document before the round__
Checklist of things to do:
- Check battery level. Atleast 150-200 min remaining
- RP2040 is correctly inserted. Loose connections may be there
- Check if any errors are logged over debug port
- check if warning light indicates failure
- Connect the RP2040 to Pi's USB2 (black) ports
- Check if light on encoders turns on - loose connection may be there
- Check if wheels are able to turn freely without touching anything else
- Ensure back lidar is in proper place, and not at an angle
- Ensure OpenCV windows are not created for the obstacle round (even for practices); merely record the videos!
